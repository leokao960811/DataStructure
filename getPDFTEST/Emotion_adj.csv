i didnt feel humiliated
i can go from feeling so hopeless to so damned hopeful just from being around someone who cares and is awake
im grabbing a minute to post i feel greedy wrong
i am ever feeling nostalgic about the fireplace i will know that it is still on the property
i am feeling grouchy
ive been feeling a little burdened lately wasnt sure why that was
ive been taking or milligrams or times recommended amount and ive fallen asleep a lot faster but i also feel like so funny
i feel as confused about life as a teenager or as jaded as a year old man
i have been with petronas for years i feel that petronas has performed well and made a huge profit
i feel romantic too
i feel like i have to make the suffering i m seeing mean something
i do feel that running is a divine experience and that i can expect to have some type of spiritual encounter
i think it s the easiest time of year to feel dissatisfied
i feel low energy i m just thirsty
i have immense sympathy with the general point but as a possible proto writer trying to find time to write in the corners of life and with no sign of an agent let alone a publishing contract this feels a little precious
i do not feel reassured anxiety is on each side
i didnt really feel that embarrassed
i feel pretty pathetic most of the time
i started feeling sentimental about dolls i had as a child and so began a collection of vintage barbie dolls from the sixties
i now feel compromised and skeptical of the value of every unit of work i put in
i feel irritated and rejected without anyone doing anything or saying anything
i am feeling completely overwhelmed i have two strategies that help me to feel grounded pour my heart out in my journal in the form of a letter to god and then end with a list of five things i am most grateful for
i have the feeling she was amused and delighted
i was able to help chai lifeline with your support and encouragement is a great feeling and i am so glad you were able to help me
i already feel like i fucked up though because i dont usually eat at all in the morning
i still love my so and wish the best for him i can no longer tolerate the effect that bm has on our lives and the fact that is has turned my so into a bitter angry person who is not always particularly kind to the people around him when he is feeling stressed
i feel so inhibited in someone elses kitchen like im painting on someone elses picture
i become overwhelmed and feel defeated
i feel kinda appalled that she feels like she needs to explain in wide and lenghth her body measures etc pp
i feel more superior dead chicken or grieving child
